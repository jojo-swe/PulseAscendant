# EVOLUTION

EVOLUTION is a real-time demo that puts 1993 and 2026 in the same frame: every effect first appears as
it looked on a 486 and then as modern hardware can render it, with Vulkan 1.3 and hardware ray tracing
as a hard requirement. It is a standalone project inside PulseAscendant; the design spec and the
implementation plans live in [`docs/plans/`](docs/plans/), starting with
[`2026-10-21-evolution-design.md`](docs/plans/2026-10-21-evolution-design.md).

> **Status:** step 0 of the plan. The build renders only a compute-shader test pattern; the demo itself
> comes in later steps.

## Requirements

- A GPU with Vulkan 1.3 and ray tracing: `VK_KHR_acceleration_structure`, `VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline`,
  `VK_KHR_ray_query` and `VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations`. Without them EVOLUTION names what is missing
  and exits with code 2; there is no fallback.
- Windows 10/11 or Linux.

Dependencies (SDL3, Vulkan-Headers, volk, VulkanMemoryAllocator) are fetched by CMake with git at
configure time, each pinned to an exact commit, so the first configure needs network access and `git`.
Shaders are compiled at build time with `glslangValidator`.

## Build on Linux

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build glslang-tools libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev \
    libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxfixes-dev libxss-dev libxtst-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev \
    libegl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libvulkan-dev
sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers   # optional: lavapipe, a software Vulkan driver for testing

cd evolution
cmake --preset linux
cmake --build --preset linux
ctest --preset linux
```

The executable is `build/linux/bin/Evolution`, with its shaders in `build/linux/bin/shaders/`. The tests run
headless (they also pass on lavapipe) and need Python 3, which configure looks for. Tests that open a
window are off by default; configure with `-DEVO_RUNTIME_TESTS=ON` to run them under `xvfb-run`.

## Build on Windows

> The Windows preset has not been exercised yet. The steps below are what it is designed for.

Requirements:

- Visual Studio 2026 with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
- CMake 4.2 or newer: the preset uses the `Visual Studio 18 2026` generator, which first shipped in
  CMake 4.2 (the project itself needs only 3.25).
- The [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/), for `glslangValidator`; CMake looks for it in
  `%VULKAN_SDK%\Bin`. The Vulkan runtime itself comes with the GPU driver.
- Git, and Python 3 (configure looks for it; the tests run it).

```bat
cd evolution
cmake --preset windows
cmake --build --preset windows
ctest --preset windows
```

The preset builds Release into `build\windows\`; the executable is `build\windows\bin\Evolution.exe`,
with its shaders in `build\windows\bin\shaders\` (no per-configuration subdirectory, so a Debug build
replaces the Release one).

## Usage

Run `Evolution` without arguments for a 1280×720 window; Esc quits and F11 toggles fullscreen.

```text
Usage: Evolution [options]

Options:
  --width N            Render width in pixels, 16..8192 (default 1280)
  --height N           Render height in pixels, 16..8192 (default 720)
  --fps N              Frames per second for headless output, 1..240 (default 60)
  --time S             Start time on the timeline in seconds, 0..86400 (default 0)
  --duration S         Seconds to run; 0 runs until Esc (default 0). --render-stream
                       needs a duration greater than 0
  --headless           Render without opening a window
  --render-stream      Write raw RGB frames to stdout (implies --headless)
  --capture-dir PATH   Write one PNG frame, at --time, to PATH (implies --headless)
  --validation         Enable the Vulkan validation layers
  --device-info        Print information about the selected GPU and exit
  --fullscreen         Start the window in fullscreen
  -h, --help           Show this help and exit
```

Examples:

```sh
# One PNG of the frame at t = 1.5 s: writes and prints out/frame-001.500.png
Evolution --capture-dir out --time 1.5 --width 1920 --height 1080

# Two seconds at 30 fps as raw RGB, straight into ffmpeg
Evolution --render-stream --width 640 --height 360 --fps 30 --duration 2 |
    ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pixel_format rgb24 -video_size 640x360 -framerate 30 -i - out.mp4

# The selected GPU as JSON
Evolution --device-info
```

`--render-stream` writes frames `0 .. ceil(duration × fps) − 1` at `t = time + i / fps`, top-down,
3 bytes per pixel, with progress on stderr. `--capture-dir` creates missing directories and overwrites
an existing file of the same name. With `--validation`, validation messages go to stderr, so they never
mix with streamed frames.

Exit codes: 0 on success, 1 for bad usage or a runtime error, 2 when the machine cannot run EVOLUTION
(no Vulkan loader, no Vulkan 1.3 driver, no GPU, or a missing extension or feature; stderr names what is
missing), and 3 when `--validation` reported any warning or error during an otherwise successful run.
